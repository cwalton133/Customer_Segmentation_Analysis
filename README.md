## 🧭 Business Context
SmartHome Solutions Inc. operates in a competitive consumer electronics and household appliances market where efficient production planning and supply chain agility are critical. Reliance on traditional forecasting methods has resulted in production inefficiencies, excess inventory, and misalignment with evolving customer demand patterns.

Customer segmentation provides a structured approach to understanding customer behavior, preferences, and demand variability, enabling more accurate production and inventory decisions.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of the Project
The primary objective of this project is to leverage **customer segmentation and exploratory data analysis** to enhance:
- Production planning accuracy  
- Inventory management efficiency  
- Demand-driven supply chain decision-making  

By transforming raw customer and sales data into actionable insights, the project supports a more customer-centric and cost-efficient supply chain strategy.

## 🗂️ Dataset Description

### Raw Datasets
👉 [customer.xlsx](raw/customer.xlsx)  
👉 [inventory.xlsx](raw/inventory.xlsx)  
👉 [sales_data.xlsx](raw/sales_data.xlsx)  
👉 [production.xlsx](raw/production.xlsx)

### Processed Dataset
👉 [solution.xlsx](processed/solution.xlsx)

The raw datasets contain unprocessed customer demographics, sales transactions, inventory levels, and production records. These datasets were cleaned, transformed, and consolidated into a structured format for analysis and visualization.

## 🔍 Methodology (CRISP-DM)
1. **Business Understanding** – Identify production and supply chain challenges  
2. **Data Understanding** – Explore customer, sales, inventory, and production data  
3. **Data Preparation** – Clean, transform, and integrate datasets  
4. **Modeling** – Perform customer segmentation and demand analysis  
5. **Evaluation** – Validate insights against business objectives  
6. **Deployment** – Communicate insights through dashboards and recommendations

## 💡 Key Insights
- Distinct customer segments exhibit significantly different purchasing patterns  
- High-value customer segments drive a disproportionate share of revenue  
- Demand variability is concentrated within specific geographic and income-based segments  
- Excess inventory is largely driven by misalignment between production output and high-demand segments

---

## 🧠 Strategic Recommendations
1. Implement segment-based production planning models  
2. Prioritize inventory allocation for high-value customer segments  
3. Reduce overproduction by aligning output with demand trends  
4. Integrate customer analytics into ongoing supply chain planning processes  
5. Continuously monitor segment-level demand changes
